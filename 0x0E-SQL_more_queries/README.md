## Description

In this project, we explore advanced SQL queries to perform various operations on relational databases. The queries are designed to solve specific problems or extract meaningful insights from the data stored in the database. By completing these exercises, you'll gain proficiency in writing complex SQL queries and manipulating data effectively.

## Files

- **0-select_states.sql**: SQL script to select all states from a database table.
- **1-select_states.sql**: SQL script to select states starting with 'N' from a database table.
- **2-select_cities.sql**: SQL script to select all cities from a database table.
- **3-select_cities.sql**: SQL script to select cities starting with 'N' from a database table.
- **4-venues_by_state.sql**: SQL script to select venues ordered by state.
- **5-genre_id_by_show.sql**: SQL script to select genre IDs by show.
- **6-genre_id_by_show.sql**: SQL script to select genre IDs not used.
- **7-genre_id_by_show.sql**: SQL script to select shows by genre.
- **8-genre_id_by_show.sql**: SQL script to select genres by show.
- **9-need_a_name.sql**: SQL script to list all shows without a genre.
- **10-count_shows_by_genre.sql**: SQL script to count shows by genre.
- **11-count_shows_by_genre.sql**: SQL script to count genres in the show database.
- **12-shows_by_genre.sql**: SQL script to select shows by genre with their count.

## Usage

To run these SQL queries, you'll need access to a database management system (DBMS) such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQLite. Simply execute each SQL script using the appropriate command-line tool or database client, ensuring that you are connected to the correct database.

Example (using MySQL command-line tool):


Replace `username` with your database username, `database_name` with the name of the database you're using, and `0-select_states.sql` with the name of the SQL script you want to execute.
