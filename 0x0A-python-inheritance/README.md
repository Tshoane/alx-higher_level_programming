0x0A Python Inheritance

This project covers various concepts related to inheritance in Python programming language.

## Description

The project contains Python scripts demonstrating inheritance, subclassing, method overriding, and related concepts.

## Project Content

- `0-rectangle.py`: Defines an empty Rectangle class.
- `1-rectangle.py`: Defines a Rectangle class with width and height attributes.
- `2-rectangle.py`: Adds area and perimeter calculations to the Rectangle class.
- `3-rectangle.py`: Includes string representation functionality for the Rectangle class.
- `4-rectangle.py`: Adds a method to print the representation of the Rectangle class.
- `5-base_geometry.py`: Defines an empty BaseGeometry class.
- `6-base_geometry.py`: Adds an area calculation method to the BaseGeometry class.
- `7-base_geometry.py`: Adds integer validation to the area calculation method in BaseGeometry.
- `8-rectangle.py`: Implements a class Rectangle that inherits from BaseGeometry.
- `9-rectangle.py`: Extends the functionality of the Rectangle class by adding width and height validation.
- `101-add_attribute.py`: Includes a function to add new attributes to an object if possible.

## Usage

Each script in the project can be executed individually. For example:

```bash
python3 1-rectangle.py
This will execute the script that defines the Rectangle class with width and height attributes.
