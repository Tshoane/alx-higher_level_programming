# 0x07 - Python Test-driven Development

This repository contains resources and code examples for learning and implementing Test-driven development (TDD) in Python.

## Overview

Test-driven development is a software development process that emphasizes writing tests before writing the actual code. It follows a cycle of writing tests, writing code to pass those tests, and then refactoring the code. This approach helps in creating more robust, maintainable, and bug-free code.

## Contents

- **src**: Contains the source code for Python modules.
- **tests**: Contains test files for unit testing the code.
- **docs**: Additional documentation or resources related to TDD.
- **examples**: Code examples demonstrating TDD principles.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/0x07-python-test-driven-development.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd 0x07-python-test-driven-development
    ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4. Explore the `src` and `tests` directories to understand the structure and examples provided.
5. Run the tests to see how TDD works:
    ```bash
    python -m unittest discover -s tests
    ```
